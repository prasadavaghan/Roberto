<h1 align="center">Welcome to Roberto 👋</h1>

Project <strong>Roberto</strong> is a portfolio template for a luxury hotel group, where users can browse and book rooms in luxury hotels all around the globe.

In this project we have tried to clone the front end of <strong>Roberto</strong>. With our efforts and the technology stack, that we have learned so far in the masai school, we were able to clone the front end with high precision and quality.

<br/>

- This is a basic template for a Hotel group portfolio
- and it was made in 1 week.
- The technologies used are beginner friendly and easy to use.
- If you are interested in contributing to this project feel free to do so.
